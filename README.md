# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and background for potential employers.

The site is built with Astro, focusing on fast load times, minimal client-side JavaScript, and a clean, accessible design. Astro allows the site to be mostly static while still supporting interactive elements where appropriate.

The portfolio includes:
- A landing page with a short introduction and links to external profiles
- A projects section highlighting selected work
- An about page with background and technical interests
- Contact links for getting in touch

This project is intended to evolve over time as I complete new work and refine the presentation.
